      Wildcat Software was contracted by the SITC department to create a game to
      send to incomming and prospective students. We decided to create a
      survival game in the Mabee Business Building so the environment would be
      familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this game, cats are breaking into the building and want to steal your
      snacks. In order to protect yourself, you throw water balloons at the
      cats.

      This game will be published in a few days for mobile devices. You can play
      the current version on a computer right now by clicking the button below.
      Currently not supported for mobile devices.

      This was a simple adventure game by Brighton Mica and I in C++. In order
      to make the game more interesting instead of just reading text, we decided
      to create text animations to make the game more visual.

      he must fight. When he fights, he knows that he is alive. When he wins, he
      knows that there will be another day for him to fight. That is life for
      Robo. It’s very simple; it’s very predictable; it’s everything a fighting
      robot could ever want. What if that is not his true purpose at all? That
      would be quite unfortunate."

      A 3D animated film project directed by Donte' Pane and Lauren Mullen, this
      film premiered at FilmFest 2019. It was created in realtime with the Unity
      game engine.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this project, I was the Co-Cinematographer. I helped Lauren execute
      her vision for the film by placing the dozens of different camera and
      dolly shots in the film so it looked great.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also created the pocketwatch, which has a chain attached to it. I had to
      create a script in Unity to be able to easily create the chain.

      This is a VR Carnival game that I am currently making in Unity. Currently,
      Skee-Ball is a fully functioning game, and it's a blast to play.
    </p>

    <p>
      When finished, the Bowling game will be a bowling alley quality game,
      complete with a functioning pinsetter.
    </p>

    <p>Each game piece was created by me in Blender.</p>

    <p>
      When this project is finished, I will upload a video demoing each carnival
      game.

      Block Tower is a mobile puzzle physics game where you try to stack blocks
      to the top of the screen. By tapping on a block moving back and forth at
      the top of the screen, you place the block onto a small base on the bottom
      of the screen. If you don’t tap at the right time and place the block
      incorrectly, you can cause the tower to fall. The level is finished when
      the tower reaches the top of the screen. As the game progresses, blocks
      start getting more difficult to stack with more complex shapes and sizes.
