  ​I spent a great deal of time on this project, mainly because I loved the
  beauty of the Chapel on the Hill, so a majority of the time went into the
  complex texturing and rendering of the stained glass. But, as the stained
  glass is the most beautiful, it makes the rest of the building look just as
  great.

    <figure class="image is-marginless">
      <img src="/assets/images/bible-pics.png" alt="Image" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      In order to accurately recreate the stained glass, I took a picture of the
      80 different panes of glass.

      Before even beginnging the modeling process for this building, I had to
      walk around the building and take over a hundred pictures of every angle
      to capture every detail.

    <figure class="image is-marginless">
      <img src="/assets/images/stone.png" alt="Image" />
    </figure>
  </div>

  Lastly, I accurately recreated the brick, granite, and other textures in order
  for the building to look as realistic as possible.
